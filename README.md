ArtLife: Computational life as exploratory art

A personal project positioned at the crossroads of computational biology, artificial life, machine learning, digital art and related interests. Built using JavaScript on top of node.js and d3.js.

I'll do my best to keep this README up to date as I progress on this project. The majority of what I have in mind for this project will have to first be learned so I suspect it will be slow-going, but if I can get what is in my head into the code window, the result will be pretty cool.

Cheers,
Don
