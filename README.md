ArtLife: Computational life as exploratory art

A personal project positioned at the crossroads of computational biology, artificial life, machine learning, digital art and related interests.

I'll do my best to keep this README up to date as I make progress. The majority of what I have in mind for this project will require a great deal of learning so I suspect it will be slow-going. But if I can get what is in my head into the code window, the result will be pretty cool.
